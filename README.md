# devRoom
The "devRoom" project is a web-based application built with the Django framework that enables users to join virtual chat rooms centered around specific topics. Once a user joins a room, they can communicate with other users by sending and receiving messages.

The application has the following features:

User Authentication: Users can sign up and log in to access the application's features.

Room Creation: Users can create new chat rooms with specific topics.

Room Joining: Users can join existing chat rooms and view messages posted by other users in the room.

Messaging: Users can send messages in a chat room and receive messages from other users in real-time.

Notifications: Users receive notifications when a new message is posted in a chat room they have joined.

The "devRoom" project is useful for developers who want to collaborate and discuss specific topics with other developers in real-time. With the ability to create new chat rooms and join existing ones, users can easily find and connect with like-minded individuals to share knowledge and solve problems together.
